Question 1:
- Create an ArrayList of Media, then add some media (CD, DVD, or Book) to the list.
- Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using the toString() method.
Observe what happens and explain it in detail.

As we iterate through the list, the objects are printed out exactly according to its concrete implementation of the toString() method.
